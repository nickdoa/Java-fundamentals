# java-fundamentals
Welcome to my Java repository! 

## Introduction

This project documents my journey into the world of Java programming. I was inspired to this language thanks to the iconic game Minecraft. Realizing that Minecraft's core mechanics relied on the Java programming language sparked curiosity within me. This path ultimately helped me acquire the fundamental skills necessary to program not just in Java, but for other languages as well. Here, you'll see my progression, code samples, and resources as I study Java.

## Repository Content
Here's a glimpse of what you can find here:

Code Samples: I've documented my progress with Java by creating various code samples. From basic "Hello World" to more complex programs such as a Blackjack where you can play against a computer.

Learning Resources: Along the way, I've compiled a list of invaluable resources that have helped me in my Java learning adventure. If you're a novice, these resources might provide guidance and insights into Java.

## Final Reflection:

Java has been very rewarding. Although I struggled with the challenge of getting familiar with Java's verbosity, in the end, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate how it promotes the best practices. 

Today, Java stands as my inaugural experience into the world of programming. It has provided me with an understanding of fundamental concepts and principles from variables to object-oriented programming. This journey has been pivotal in shaping my perspective on programming, and has equipped me with a solid platform upon which I can explore more programming languages in the future.
